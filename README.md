# Crime data visualization

### **Project Goal** 
- 
  This project aims to create visual representations of crime data across the United States. The primary objectives include refining the data, performing comprehensive processing, and employing various visualization techniques to enhance clarity and comprehension. The goal is to present the information in ways that are easily understandable and accessible.
